#In this React project, I utilized the following:

1. @reduxjs/toolkit:
   - Used for state management and to simplify the configuration of Redux.

2. @tinymce/tinymce-react:
   - Integrated the TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor into the project for enhanced text editing capabilities.

3. appwrite:
   - Implemented Appwrite, a backend service, for authentication, database, and file storage functionalities.

4. html-react-parser:
   - Employed for parsing and rendering HTML content within React components.

5. react and react-dom:
   - Core React libraries used for building user interfaces and rendering components.

6. react-hook-form:
   - Incorporated for simplifying form management in React, providing hooks for form state and validation.

7. react-redux:
   - Used to connect React components with the Redux state, enabling efficient state management.

8. react-router-dom:
   - Integrated for navigation and routing within the React application, facilitating the creation of dynamic and navigable UIs.

These dependencies collectively contribute to the development of a robust React application with enhanced state management, text editing capabilities, backend services through Appwrite, HTML parsing, form handling, and efficient routing.
